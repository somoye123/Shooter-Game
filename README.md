Implementation of a Space Shooter Game built with the [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/phaser3) framework

## About The Project

The main objective of this project was to design and build a platform game. The basics of the game are used from the [Space Shooter Game](https://learn.yorkcs.com/category/tutorials/gamedev/phaser-3/build-a-space-shooter-with-phaser-3/) using Phaser and Javascript among other technologies.

## The game

In this never-ending game, you will face different enemies at random times, and you have to use your laser to make them explode. Every enemy gives you a different score point, and you need to avoid getting hit by their lasers or overlap with one of them. When the game is over , the user can restart the game.

### How to Play

- Input your name on the first page and click the submit button, There is a menu on the next page which are Play, Options, Credits and Scoreboard. You can disable the sound in the options menu. Click on the play menu to start your game. You can move around the screen using the arrow keys and use the Space Bar to shoot whenever you see an enemy. Happy gaming!
